PersianRelativeDate
===================
This is a simple class inspired by the class written by Kelsey on StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/a/3682673/27946) that returns a relative date similar to what you can see for example on Twitter. I just added a resource file and localized it for Persian language; no more!
